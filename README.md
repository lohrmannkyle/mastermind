# mastermind
Ruby project from The Odin Project meant to replicate the game mastermind and serve as practice to learn object-oriented design principles. I hadn't heard of mastermind prior to starting this but it was fun to go through the logic. I could certainly increase the effectiveness of the computer guesses when assigned the role of codebreaker but will leave algorithm as is for now. Anyways there's definitely an improvement from my tic-tac-toe so cheers to that.
